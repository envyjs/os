The Envy Kernel is a kernel inspired by the OpenHarmony LiteOS kernel, a lightweight kernel built for embedded devices such as IoT. 

While Envy Kernel is still massively work in progress, still being in pre-alpha state, Envy Kernel plans on being a high-performance, compact and low-power experience for all hardware.
